	<p id="white"> Mumbai: Former Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan expressed hope that the uninterrupted decline in the rupee will not continue as the central bank is raising the interest rate properly in order to control inflation. Due to the fear of a global trade war, the rupee rose above 72 against the US dollar and reached level of 72.45. He said that it is important for the RBI that he is consistently indicating that he will keep inflation under control. This gives investors a confidence that there will be no uninterrupted decline in the rupee as the inflation will finally be in control.</p>
<p class="yellow">Regarding the suggestion of NRI bond to pause the rupee fall in the rupee, Rajan said that this is a weapon that is in your arsenal. RBI has recently increased the policy rate twice to inflation concerns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rajan has said about the trapped debt that it is mainly due to bank officials being more optimistic and softening in growth.</p>

		<span class="ramk"> रामकथा फाउण्डेशन की ओर से पारा के राज स्टेट में आयोजित श्रीराम कथा के दूसरे दिन रामकथा मर्मज्ञ प्रेमभूषण जी महाराज ने भगवान श्रीराम के जन्मोत्सव की मनोहारी कथा सुनाई। कथा के संयोजक बुन्देलखण्ड योगी अर्पित दास महाराज ने प्रेमभूषण जी का व्यास पीठ पर जाकर सम्मान किया। समाजसेवी अजय त्रिपाठी मुन्ना भी मौजूद रहे।

भगवान भोलेनाथ का प्रसंग सुनाते हुए प्रेमभूषणजी महाराज ने कहा कि प्रभु राम की कथा भक्त को भगवान से जोड़ने का काम करती है। उन्होंने कहा कि हमें मर्यादा पुरुषोत्तम श्रीराम के आचरण को अपने अन्दर धारण करना चाहिए। हमे अपनी सुख - सुविधा के साथ दूसरे की भी सुख - सुविधा का ध्यान रखना चाहिए ।
